# Boosted Survivors Upgrades

Just a small website showing all the upgrades I've found for the indie game Boosted Survivors.

It uses [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) to show the upgrades in a graph, while also making use of the extensions [cytoscape.js-dagre](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-dagre) and [cytoscape.js-klay](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-klay) for extra layout options, and [cytoscape.js-popper](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-popper) (with [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/)) to generate custom tooltips when selecting a node in the graph.

Do note that this was made focusing usage on PC, and even though I did make adjustments for mobile as well, the best experience is still on PC.
